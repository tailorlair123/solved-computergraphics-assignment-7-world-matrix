This assignment (start from file index.html) is similar to the one in the previous three assignments. It requires to create a set of world matrices in file world.js. The position, scaling and orientation required each time, is specified in the comments of file world.js. Rotation is always expressed using Euler Angles, in y-up convention, where the object is originally oriented toward the positive z-axis. By pressing the space bar, you can check whether your matrices matches the correct solution.
